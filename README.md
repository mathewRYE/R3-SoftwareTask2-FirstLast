# R3-SoftwareTask2-FirstLast
 My project is composed of two python files, one file is for the server and one is for the client. I connected the two files to two corresponding bat files I created, the bat files will act as the input and output. I created a host and a port and connected the two python files via import socket, and the host and port. Using the key and getwch functions, my code reads inputs that are made through a keyboard, and converts them to a string. Then I created two dictionaries that convert keyboard inputs into speed and direction values. My code loops through the dictionary for the inputs, and sends them to the server/output. The server receives and splits the data into values for speed and direction, that are then outputted into the server bat file. I unfortunately was not able to complete the project. All I had left to do, was implement the pwm directions, however I did not have time. I was busy preparing for midterms this week, and I also have to work, which left me with very little time to work on this project. However I was able to get this far, and almost complete it.
